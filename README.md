## Overview :memo:

Cooking is a process that may be seen by some as an artistic hobby, while for others it may be a part of their daily routine. With the pandemic and lockdown, people were confined to their homes, with no access to food delivery compelling many to learn cooking. <br />
A recipe app catering to different cuisines and delicacies will enable various social groups belonging to different ages to try something that is either authentic or a twist to the traditions. <br />
Recipes communicate the ingredients and procedures of making a dish, along with educating the user about the combinations of various textures and flavors.
